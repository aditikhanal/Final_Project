## 📘 Overview
This project explores the use of **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques to predict **ICU length of stay (LOS)** using **Electronic Health Records (EHR)**.  
The goal is to classify patients into **short-stay** and **long-stay** categories to improve **patient care**, **resource allocation**, and **hospital efficiency**.

The study compares several ML algorithms — **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, **Logistic Regression**, and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and also conducts time series based approach using **LSTM model**
